B-MUL-100_my_screensaver

The my_screensaver is part of the C Graphical Programming module at Epitech.
This was the first project i’ve ever done in Graphical Programming, so be indulgent with the quality of the code i’ve produced.

## Compiling
You will need the standard libC, Make and the CSFML.
Just execute the following command :

 make all clean

## Usage

    ./my_screensaver [OPTIONS] animation_id
     animation_id		ID of the animation to process (between 1 and 20).
You can show the full helper by executing :

    ./my_screensaver -h

## Notes
Feel free to submit any ideas or report bugs (except the 3re animation core dump).
I encourage you to fork the project and use it in any way.
